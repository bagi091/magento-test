# Magento 2 - demo theme

1. Theme based on Magento2 Blank. In current case using Luma is unnecessary dependency.
2.
3. Also I can hide product name by CSS but I think you meant to remove from HTML.
4. Also I can change title using `i18n/en_US.csv` but I try to avoid this in case when we need to rename common words or phrases in one place.
5. Also I can rewrite styles on flexbox and use flexbox `order`. In that case it will be more difficult.
6. I think I didn't understand this task. Speaking of accordion (tabs) Magento provides a lot of technical capabilities. It's the same for media-check too.
7. I could also do it using jQuery widget Modal but I prefer to use knockout style.
8. 
9. If it need only when changing shipping address form I can do it as validation rule.
